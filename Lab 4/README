Start the FTP server on gamma.cse.ohio-state.edu with the command:
    python3 ftps.py <local-port-on-gamma> <troll-port-on-gamma>
Note that the server will receive only one file before it exits.

Start the troll client process on beta.cse.ohio-state.edu with the command:
    troll -C <IP-address-of-beta> -S <IP-address-of-gamma> -a <client-port-on-beta> -b <server-port-on-gamma> <troll-port-on-beta> -t -x <packet-drop-%>
Use 127.0.0.1 for <IP-address-of-beta>. The <client-port-on-beta> is hardcoded to be 5195.

Start the troll server process on gamma.cse.ohio-state.edu with the command:
    troll -C <IP-address-of-gamma> -S <IP-address-of-beta> -a <server-port-on-gamma> -b <client-port-on-beta> <troll-port-on-gamma> -t -x <packet-drop-%>
Use 127.0.0.1 for <IP-address-of-gamma>. The <client-port-on-beta> is hardcoded to be 5195.

Initiate a transfer with the FTP client on beta.cse.ohio-state.edu with the command:
    python3 ftpc.py <IP-address-of-gamma> <remote-port-on-gamma> <troll–port-on-beta> <local-file-to-transfer>


Note that the client will not terminate if the server's last ACK is dropped,
since the server terminates directly after receiving the end of the file
and sending the final ACK. Solving this is beyond the scope of this project.
